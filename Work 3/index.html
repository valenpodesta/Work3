<h1>Why record heat doesn't mean record solar power</h1>

<p>The UK's heatwave is helping to generate large amounts of solar power - but experts say it's actually too hot for the highest levels of electricity generation.
Trade body Solar Energy UK says the last few days have seen about 10% of Britain's electricity come from solar.</p>

<p>But its chief executive Chris Hewett says: "The heat itself brings down the efficiency of solar panels slightly. So don't expect to see records set."</p>

<h2>Some more information</h2>

<p>This week has seen the UK record its highest ever day and night temperatures, with heat warnings being put in place for much of the country. Climate change is a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earthâ€™s local, regional and global climates. These changes have a broad range of observed effects that are synonymous with the term.</p>
